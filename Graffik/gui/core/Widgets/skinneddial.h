/** Custom-Skinned QDial

  This class allows one to create a custom-skinned QDial by supplying your own image
  for the background and needle, both through Qt Style Sheets and through normal C++
  usage.

  Example Usage:
  @code
  #include "skinneddial.h"

  ...

  SkinnedDial* myDial = new SkinnedDial();
  @endcode

  All look and feel is provided through images, you cannot have hash marks drawn programmatically, if you
  want them, put them in your image.

  @section dialvalues Acceptable QDial Limits

  The SkinnedDial class makes an assumption that the center of the dial is at the value of 0, and
  that negative values are on the left side of the dial, and the positive values are on the right
  side.  SkinnedDial requires that the minimum be < 0 and the maximum be > 0 and that there be
  an equivalent distance on both side of the dial. For example:

  @code
  myDial->setMaximum(100);
  myDial->setMinimum(-100);
  @endcode

  You must also specify where the maximum travel of the dial is, in degrees.
  See the \ref qsscustom "Customing the look and feel via QSS" section for more information.

  @section qsscustom Customizing the look and feel via QSS

  You can control the look and feel of the SkinnedDial via Qt Stylesheets by setting values for the custom
  properties associated with the skinned dial.

  It is expected that the backgroundImage and needleImage are of the exact same dimensions, and the needleImage
  is transparent everywhere the needle isn't.

  The maxAngle property determines the extent that the needle may travel on either side of the circle.  140' would
  imply that the needle may not move more than 140' either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

  @code
  SkinnedDial {
    qproperty-backgroundImage: url(:dial-back.png);
    qproperty-needleImage: url(:dial-needle.png);
    qproperty-maxAngle: 140;
   }
   @endcode

   @section scaling Scaling of Images

   Your images are automatically scaled relative to the container, up and to the full size of the input
   image.  The input image will not be scaled larger than its original size.
