In      Progressive display, the top of the track represents the cruising speed      for the move, and thus the highest range shown is the cruising speed      required for the move to be completed.  In Relative display, the top of      the track represents the configured Maximum speed for the motor, and all      speed points are relative to the maximum configured speed.  For relative      display, the motion track may exceed the top of the area, showing the      required speed is well beyond the capabilities of the motor.</p>    <h3>Curve</h3>    <p>The Curve selection controls the type of acceleration and deceleration      profiles used.  You have three options: Linear, Quadratic, and Inverse      Quadratic.  When changing this selection, the motion track will      immediately update showing the impact on the movement.</p>    <h3>Mute</h3>    <p>You may mute the track to prevent it from operating during playback.  In      case of an error, the track will automatically be muted for you and will      not be able to be re-enabled until the error is resolved.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <p><br />    </p>    <h2>Motion Editor</h2>    <p>Once a start and end point for a motor have been set with the Jog      Controls, a default motion profile will be drawn in the Motion Editor for      that track.  Mousing over the editor area will cause grab handles to      appear at four key points in the move: The beginning of movement, the end      of acceleration, the beginning of deceleration, and the end of movement.       You can drag and adjust any of these to your liking, and the motor will      arrive at its set destination according to this profile.  <br />    </p>    <p>If you happen cause the motor to exceed its maximum configured speed, the      background will go slightly red, and the track will be muted.  Simply      adjust the start and end points as required to bring the move back into      one the motor can achieve.</p>    <p>Clicking on any part of the editor window that isn't a grab handle will      show a tooltip with information about that track at that point: the time,      the speed of the motor, and the position.<br />    </p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <p><br />    </p>    <h2>Global Controls</h2>    <p>The global controls are present on every workflow screen.  They provide      options relevant to all workflows.  The workflow drop-down allows you to      select which workflow screen to work with, presently the Film workflow or      the Slim Scripting workflow.  The Save and Load buttons allow you to save      a file representing the current workflow.  On the Film screen, it lets you      save a film file (ending in .film) that represents everything you've set      up for the current film, and on the Scripting screen, it lets you save a      script file (ending in .slim) containing all of the commands you've      entered.</p>    <p>Additionally, the Device Manager and Global Options can be accessed via      the Global Controls.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <p><br />    </p>    <h2>Camera Control</h2>    <p>The Camera Control selector lets you configure whether or not the camera      will be controlled by one of the attached nanoMoCo-based nodes.  Without      enabling camera control, you will only be able to shoot real-time video.       For time-lapse use, the camera control selector must be turned on.  Once      this selector is turned on, the Camera Control parameters may be      configured by clicking the settings button.  The following settings are      available:</p>    <h3>Use Film Time</h3>    <p>This is the default option enabled.  When use film time is enabled, the      interval is automatically determined by specifying the Film Length on the      Film Workflow screen.  The Film Length will be limited by the Real Time of      the Film, The Frames per Second setting, and the minimal achievable      interval based on your other camera control settings.  If this option is      disabled, the Manual Interval option will be made available.</p>    <h3>Frames Per Second</h3>    <p>The Frames Per Second input allows you to specify the frames per second      of the output film you intend to make.  This is used to assist in limiting      the maximum Film Time you can specify when Use Film Time is enabled, or to      display the final output film time when Use Film Time is disabled.       Additionally, total frame and current frame display <br />    </p>    <h3>Manual Interval</h3>    <p>If Use Film Time is disabled, the Manual Interval selector will be      shown.  If this is turned on, you will be able to input the interval at      which the camera is fired.  If it is turned off, the fastest possible      interval will be used based on your other settings.</p>    <h3>Shoot Move Shoot</h3>    <p>The default mode of operation is Continuous - that is, the motor moves      while the camera is firing.  If you wish to have the motor be still during      exposures, or to perform a stop-motion film, you should enable this      option.  Once this option is enabled, you will have the ability to pause      the film during execution, or advance in single frames.</p>    <h3>Bulb Exposure</h3>    <p>If you wish to control the exposure time off-camera, such as for very      long exposures, enable this option.  After enabling this option, you will      be able to specify the exposure time in seconds.  If this is disabled, an      exposure time of 0.2s will be used, and you will be expected to set the      exposure time on your camera, and the proper Exposure Delay below.</p>    <h3>Exposure Delay</h3>    <p>When controlling the exposure time on your camera, it is very important      to specify the correct exposure delay in the camera controls.  This input      specifies how long (in seconds) the motion nodes should wait after      exposing the camera before triggering other actions.  Failure to provide      enough time can result in exposures being triggered before the camera is      ready, or movement during an exposure in SMS mode.</p>    <h3>Focus Lock</h3>    <p>The Focus Lock setting determines whether or not the focus line should be      tied to the exposure line, such that the focus is always triggered with      the exposure.  This is required for correct operation on many cameras, and      should only be turned off if it presents problems.</p>    <h3>Focus Control</h3>    <p>Focus Control determines whether or not the focus line should be      triggered before triggering an exposure.  This would be used in some      special workflow situations where the camera needs to be woken up (when      using very long intervals, for example), or in special cases using      auto-focus.  When enabled, you are given the opportunity to express the      focus time in seconds.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <h2>Jog Control</h2>    <p>The Jog Control area is the primary means for interacting with your motor      axes for film setup.  First, select an axis from the list of available      axes, and then you will be able to move the motor in either direction      using the jog wheel.  Once you position the motor at its starting point,      press the home button and then jog the motor to its final position, and      press the end button.  </p>    <p>You may adjust the maximum speed of the jog wheel and the damping time      using the sliders.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <h2>Time Inputs</h2>    <p>The Time Inputs allow you to configure the Real Time of the film, and the      Film Time when appropriate.  If you have setup the Camera Configuration to      Use Film Time, you will be able to specify the output film time up and to      the maximum possible film time based on the real time of the film, and the      other settings you have configured.  If you have not setup the Camera      Configuration to Use Film Time, the Film Time Input will be disabled and      will instead show the actual output film time based on your parameters.</p>    <p>You may use the arrow keys, mouse wheel, or click and scroll on these      inputs to change them.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 85%; color: black;" />    <h2>Shuttle Controls</h2>    <p>The Shuttle Controls allow you to execute the film you have created.  The      Full Forward and Full Reverse seek all nodes to the their home or ends      respectively, and are only active when the film is stopped.  The Frame      Advance / Rewind controls move the film forward one frame, and take one      shot - they are only available when Shoot Move Shoot is enabled.  The Play      button sends all non-muted tracks home, and then begins executing the      film.  If Shoot Move Shoot is enabled, the Play button will change to      pause during execution, allowing you to pause and resume filming.  Pause      is unavailable during continuous moves, as it is not possible to smoothly      start a motor at a speed greater than zero.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 100%; color: black;" />    <h1>Device Operations</h1>    <p>To effectively use Graffik, you must have one or more devices added and      configured.  This section will give a brief overview of the different ways      to manage and add devices.</p>    <h2>Add A Bus</h2>    <p>Before you can add any devices, you must add a Bus.  A Bus is a      USB-connected set of devices all sharing the same port.  Before attempting      to add a Bus, make sure your USB adapter or Cable is properly connected      and shown as working in your operating system.  <br />    </p>    <p>To add a Bus, click on the Devices button.  The default screen shown will      be the Device Manager, on this screen, press the "Add Bus" button.  After      pressing this button, select the correct communications port, and give the      Bus a unique name.</p>    <h2>Initializing A Device for the First Time</h2>    <p>If you have just received your device, or have just performed a factory      reset on it, it must be initialized.  <b>Connect one, and only one        uninitialized device at a time</b>.  </p>    <p>To initialize a device, connect it to the bus (there may be other,      already initialized devices on the bus) and press the Initialize Device      button in the Devices window.   A quick scan for the device will be      performed, and if it is found, you will be prompted to move to the next      step.  At the next step, select the type of device, give it a unique      address, and a unique name.</p>    <h2>Scanning For Devices</h2>    <p>If you are connecting one or more devices that have already been      configured, you can scan for devices.  The Scan for Devices button will      scan the entire bus address space, and look for any known device types on      the bus.  Once the scan has been completed, you will be prompted to add      each device found. <br />    </p>    <h2>Configuring a Device</h2>    <p>Before using a device, it is important that you configure it properly.       To configure a device, within the Device Manager, select the configure      icon next to the Device Name. <br />    </p>    <h3>Master Device</h3>    <p>A master device must always be chosen to shoot a film, the purpose of the      master device is to synchronize other nodes, provide information back to      the user interface about operation, and control the camera if camera      control is enabled.  Failure to configure a device as a master will result      in an error when attempting to start a film.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 100%; color: black;" />    <h1>Common Film Types</h1>    <h2>Real-Time Video</h2>    <p>For real-time video, you are expected to start your camera filming      manually, and then press play in Graffik to execute the moves.  This is      the most simple form of filming, and Camera Control should be disabled.</p>    <p>Define your movements, specify the real time of the video, and press      play.<br />    </p>    <h2>Easy Continuous Time-Lapse Video</h2>    <p>For basic time-lapse videos, where exposures are less than one second,      simply enable Camera Control.  Now, you may define your movements, specify      the real-time of the video, the output video time (up and to the maximum      possible time), and then press play.</p>    <h2>Longest Possible Time-Lapse Video</h2>    <p>Graffik can automatically make the longest possible time-lapse video      given your settings.  To operate in this way, enable camera control, and      in the camera control configuration, disable the Use Film Time option, and      specify the correct frames per second of your final video.  Now, when      adjusting parameters either for the camera, or for the real-time of the      video, the Film Time will automatically display the real length of your      final video.</p>    <h2>Manual Time-Lapse Video</h2>    <p>By controlling the interval manually, you will control exactly how your      timelapse film is executed.  You can also configure other options, such as      bulb control, focus control, and more.</p>    <p></p>    <hr style="width: 100%; color: black;" />    <h1>Global Options</h1>    <p>The following Global Options are available:</p>    <h2>Display Units</h2>    <p>Specify motion units in steps, imperial (inches), or metric      (centimeters).   For rotary movements, any selection other than steps will      always display in degrees.</p>    <h2>Stop on any Error</h2>    <p>Forces a stop any time an error is received from a node.  This setting      should generally be left on unless there is a specific hardware or system      problem which cannot be corrected that does not otherwise impact node      operations.</p>    <h2>Theme</h2>    <p>Select from any available themes to change the look and feel of the UI.</p>    <h2>Clear all Options</h2>    <p>Clears all configured settings, buses, devices, and more.  You must      re-start Graffik after clearing options for it to fully take effect.</p>    <p><br />    </p>    <p><br />    </p>    <p><br />    </p>    <p><br />    </p>    <p><br />    </p>    <p><br />    </p>  </body></html>
